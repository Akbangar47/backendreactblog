Starting at Rs 23,999, the phone comes with a Snapdragon 778G  processor, 66W fast charging, and other features, which are geared towards gaming. Now I have used a number of phones running this same processor already, and all of them seem to target a particular use case. The Xiaomi 11 Lite NE 5G for instance, is a compact phone, while the Realme 9 5G SE is a gaming phone on a budget.The iQOO Z6 Pro doesn’t seem to hit a particular string, and neither is it the most affordable phone with the chip. So should you care about this phone at all? Let’s find out.iQOO Z6 Pro specs: 6.44-inch AMOLED 90Hz screen | Snapdragon 778G chip | 64MP + 8MP + 2MP camera, 16MP front camera | 4700mAh battery with 66W fast charging One of the first things noticeable about the iQOO Z6 Pro is a unique looking rear-design, complete with two large circles holding in the three camera sensors. The phone has a plastic body but the build quality is really nice and everything feels solid to the touch when using this."

The CMA said it was concerned Google sought to illegally favor its own ad exchange services, while taking steps to exclude the services offered by rivals.“Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind pay walls,” said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive Officer.Watchdogs around the world have started to home in on the huge power that firms such as Google and Meta’s Facebook wield over ad markets — striking at the heart of the tech giants’ money making machines. Google faces a separate probe by the CMA into possible collusion over the way it operates online display advertising services.The CMA has been examining the way Google buys and sells advertising since at least 2020, saying that its advertising stack is a potential conflict of interest. It’s called for powers that would even allow for a structural changes."
