Despite his stardom, Tom has never had a film gross over $100 million on the opening weekend. But reports say that Maverick may just change that. Some estimates claim that the film could end up making $125 million in its opening weekend in the domestic market alone.According to a report in The Hollywood Reporter, “Top Gun 2 is easily headed for the biggest opening of Tom Cruise’s career at the domestic box office, with a four-day gross of at least $92 million, according to official tracking. And that’s a conservative estimate. Many pundits believe the critically acclaimed sequel could soar well north of $100 million domestically, but tracking — one of Hollywood’s favorite pastimes — has become fraught in the pandemic era. Exhibitors are especially bullish on the pic, and are even thinking $125 million-plus.”"
